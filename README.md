Source code for [https://da.ilyqrco.de/](https://da.ilyqrco.de/).

If you like the idea, feel free to run your own instance at your workplace or within your
community.

https://da.ilyqrco.de/ is powered using [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.heroku.com/postgres), and [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/). The code should
however be relatively easy to deploy in any environment.

## Notes
- By default, Cloudflare does not cache html pages. You can set a custom cache rule to cache
  all resources, including html pages.
